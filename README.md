## How to create a server:
### Docker Version
- Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) + ([MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) If you want to run outside container)
- Open Terminal and Enter:
```sh
# Database (just once) (use this if you don't have a database outside container or want to use between containers)
docker run --rm -it --name db_gc -p 2777:27017/tcp -d mongo &
# Game server (just once download resources with -download_resource 'yes' after that you can set -download_resource 'no') (remember replace 2.0.0.100 with your pc's ip and don't use "localhost" this is important)
docker run --rm -it \
--name dockergs \
-v resources:/home/dockergs/resources \
-p 22102:22102/udp \
-p 80:80/tcp \
siakbary/dockergs:ubuntu-gc-5.0 \
--database 'mongodb://2.0.0.100:2777' \
--web_ip '2.0.0.100' \
--web_port '80' \
--game_ip '2.0.0.100' \
--game_port '22102' \
--download_resource 'yes' \
--ssl 'false'
--web_url_ssl "false"
```
or if you have [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
```sh
git clone https://github.com/YuukiPS/DockerGS
cd DockerGS
# docker compose up  # windows
docker-compose up -d # linux
```
- Then type "account create yourusername" if there is a new response open the game.
- Yay

### Windows (Jar Only)
1. Download & Install [Java 17 JDK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cL4GcZ6GJV8) & [MongoDB](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcx3f0eUiAw) (If you don't have) (Remember this does not require Install Docker.)
2. Download file zip, scroll down I'm sure you can find it easily
3. Open file zip and unzip/open again file DockerGS_GC.tar
4. When you successfully unzip/open you will find "work_gc" folder click it then Extract it to folder you want (if you have an "Official/other version" Grasscutter you can overwrite it)
5. Make sure you have a (folder,file) "Resources" which you can get from [Yuuki](https://gitlab.com/yukiz/GrasscutterResources/-/archive/5.0/GrasscutterResources-5.0.zip)
6. Open Terminal (Make sure you open it by right-clicking on folder that has jar file) then type "java -jar grasscutter.jar"
7. Have fun :)

## How to build this? 
Source code YuukiPS is closed now because many people are remove "source link,credits" from public server/vip forum download, so we will only provide original [Grasscutter Quest](https://github.com/Anime-Game-Servers/Grasscutter-Quests) or [Grasscutter](https://github.com/Grasscutters/Grasscutter) version for docker/jar later.<br/>
