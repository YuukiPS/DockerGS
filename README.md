# DockerGC
DockerGC is a container that runs Grasscutter (*some anime game* server reimplementation) with just a single command.<br>
[![dockeri.co](https://dockeri.co/image/siakbary/dockergc)](https://hub.docker.com/r/siakbary/dockergc)
## How to create a server:
- Install Docker + MongoDB
- Open Terminal and Enter:
```sh
# Network (just once)
docker network create gc
# Datebase (just once) (db:27017 change ip and delete this if you already have a database)
docker run --rm -it --network gc --name db -d mongo &
# Game server (just once download resources with -f 'yes' after that you can set -f 'no')
docker run --rm -it --network gc -v resources:/home/Grasscutter/resources -p 22102:22102/udp -p 443:443/tcp siakbary/dockergc:debian-dev-4.2 -d 'mongodb://db:27017' -b 'localhost' -f 'yes'
```
or (if you have compose)
```sh
"docker compose up" or "docker-compose up"
```
- Then type "account create yourusername" if there is a new response open the game.
- done üôÇ

## How to connect: (PC)
- Before starting, open game first and then logout if you have logged in before and then exit again.
- Install Fiddler then Open Fiddler then click Tools -> Options -> HTTPS -> Check "Capture Https" and "Decrypt Https" then click "Actions" then click "Trues Root" then click yes if a popup appears.
- In Fiddler in "FiddlerScript" tab, copy script from [directed.cs](directed.cs) then click save.
- Login with your username then password with random then login. üôÇ

 ## How to connect: (Android Root) + (Fiddler PC for proxy)
- Open Fiddler then click Tools -> Options -> HTTPS -> Check "Capture Https" and "Decrypt Https".
- After you follow it, Go to Tools -> Options -> Connection -> Check "Allow remote computer to connect" and make sure the windows firewall is off and don't forget to change the port other than 8888 (change it like 8887) - [more info](https://www.telerik.com/blogs/how-to-capture-android-traffic-with-fiddler)
- In Fiddler in "FiddlerScript" tab, copy script from [directed.cs](directed.cs) then click save.
- On Phone (Android 7+), Install Magisk+MagiskTrustUserCerts - [more info](https://platinmods.com/threads/intercepting-https-traffic-from-apps-on-android-7-and-above-root.131373/)
- Change proxy on wifi settings with your server ip
- Login with your username then password with random then login. üôÇ

## How to connect: (Android No-Root) (Termux)
- do backup first (apk & data game) because patching apk cannot be updated with game that is installed now.
- Install patched apk that accepts user ca certs, unfortunately you will have to uninstall regular and [install apk patched](https://file.yuuki.me/0:/Leak/uc-patched.apk) (If file is miss/not trusted you can do it yourself with [apk-mitm](https://github.com/shroudedcode/apk-mitm))
- Install Termux
- use these commands
```sh
apt update && apt full-upgrade
pkg install python wget rustc-dev nano
python3 -m ensurepip --upgrade
python3 -m pip install --user pipx
python3 -m pipx ensurepath
export CARGO_BUILD_TARGET=aarch64-linux-android
pipx install mitmproxy
```
- Now download proxy config: 
```sh
wget https://github.com/akbaryahya/Grasscutter/raw/Patch/proxy_config.py
```
- Now run mitmproxy: 
```sh
mitmdump -s proxy_config.py -k --ssl-insecure --set block_global=false
```
- Then go to wifi settings and set proxy to 127.0.0.1 and 8080. Note that proxies are ignored if you are using a VPN.
- Open http://mitm.it/ in your browser, download certificate. Then go to settings and install it.
- Play Game
